# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Initial project setup and configuration
- Defining core data structures and entities
- Planning the data collection pipeline from OpenRouter API

## Recent Changes

- Created initial project structure with Next.js
- Set up Convex for backend/database
- Established foundational documentation with project overview

## Next Steps [?]

- Implement OpenRouter API integration

- Set up automated data collection and synchronization
- Implement basic search and filtering functionality

## Open Questions

- How frequently should we synchronize data with OpenRouter?
- What specific metrics are most valuable for determining model reliability?
- How should we structure the test suite for verifying model capabilities?
- What is the best approach for enriching model metadata beyond what OpenRouter provides?

## Current Blockers

- None identified yet

## Notes

- Project is in early initialization phase
- Focus on establishing a solid foundation before adding advanced features
