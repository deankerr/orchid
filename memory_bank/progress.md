# Progress

## What Works

### Core Application

- Basic app structure with Next.js
- Convex backend integration
- OpenRouter data schema and synchronization
- Model information display
- Model listing page with pagination
- Model detail pages with comprehensive information
- Support for all model types (text, image, file)
- Price formatting for different pricing types
- External links to model documentation
- API quirks documentation

### User Interface

- Clean, responsive UI for model browsing
- Clean display for model capabilities
- Proper handling of free vs. paid models
- Model cards with key information
- Model detail pages with specs and provider information
- Feature badges showing special capabilities (image, file)
- Provider-specific model information

## What's Left to Build

### Core Functionality

- Automated synchronization with OpenRouter API
- Filtering and sorting for model list
- Search functionality for models
- Model comparison tool
- Favorite/save models feature
- Detailed technical specifications display
- Client-side caching for performance

### User Interface

- Filter and sort controls
- Advanced search interface
- Improved mobile experience
- Loading states and transitions
- Error handling and fallbacks
- User preferences for model display

## Current Status

We have built a functional model browsing interface that displays comprehensive information about AI models from OpenRouter. Users can:

1. Browse a paginated list of available models
2. View detailed information about each model
3. See pricing information in appropriate units
4. Identify special capabilities like image or file input
5. Access external documentation via links

We've also documented OpenRouter API oddities in notes/openrouter.md for future reference.

Next, we will focus on adding filtering, sorting, and search functionality to help users find specific models more easily. We'll also work on automated synchronization with the OpenRouter API to keep model data current.

## Development Timeline

### Completed
