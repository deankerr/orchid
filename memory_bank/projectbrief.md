# Project Brief: ORCHID (OpenRouter Capability & Health Intelligence Dashboard)

## Overview

ORCHID is a comprehensive data aggregation, analysis, and visualization platform for AI models and providers available through the OpenRouter API. The system maintains a local database of model and provider information that updates regularly, allowing users to query, compare, and track changes over time.

## Core Requirements

- Regular fetching and storage of model/provider data from OpenRouter API
- Track historical changes in model availability and capabilities
- Provide search, filtering, and visualization of model information
- Enable custom metadata enrichment and categorization
- Monitor model performance and reliability across providers

## Goals

- Create a single source of truth for OpenRouter model capabilities
- Provide insights into model reliability and performance
- Enable data-driven model selection for specific use cases
- Track the evolution of AI model capabilities over time

## Project Scope

In scope:

- Data collection from OpenRouter API
- Local database for storing and querying model information
- Web interface for searching, filtering, and visualizing data
- Performance monitoring and reliability metrics
- Custom metadata enrichment

Out of scope:

- Model hosting or inference
- Training or fine-tuning capabilities
- Direct integration with other model providers outside OpenRouter
