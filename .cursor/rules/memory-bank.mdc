# Memory Bank Instructions

The Memory Bank is a collection of markdown files that serve as a single source of truth for the ORCHID project. These files help maintain context and continuity throughout development.

## How to Use

1. **Review regularly**: Before starting work on the project, review the Memory Bank files to refresh your understanding
2. **Update as you go**: When making significant changes or decisions, update the relevant Memory Bank files
3. **Reference in discussions**: When discussing the project, refer to the Memory Bank to ensure alignment

## Files Overview

- **projectbrief.md**: The foundation document that outlines what we're building and why
- **productContext.md**: Explains the problem being solved and success metrics
- **memory_bank_instructions.md**: This file - instructions for using the Memory Bank
- **activeContext.md**: Current work focus, recent changes, and next steps
- **systemPatterns.md**: System architecture, technical decisions, and design patterns
- **techContext.md**: Technologies used, development setup, and constraints
- **progress.md**: What works, what's left to build, and development status

## Content Verification Guidelines

To maintain accuracy and avoid confusion, mark unconfirmed information with a simple tag:

- **[?]** - Use this for any information that isn't fully confirmed or verified

Confirmed information should be left unmarked. This creates a clean default state where information is assumed to be factual unless explicitly marked otherwise.

Example:
"The application will use Next.js for the frontend and will implement a repository pattern for data access [?]."

There's no need to add the [?] marker to content that is:

- Already under a "Questions" header
- Phrased as a question with a question mark
- Clearly speculative by context

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. Keep entries concise and factual
2. Update files when significant changes occur
3. Ensure information is current before starting new development
4. Use Markdown formatting for readability
5. Link to external resources when appropriate rather than duplicating content
6. Add [?] to any unconfirmed information
7. Regularly review and update unconfirmed information as decisions are made
