# Project Notes

## Environment

- bun is the package manager, and script runner. The bun runtime is never actually used.
- `bun typecheck && bun lint` to check your work.
- Don't try to start the dev server. It's already running in my terminal.

## Libraries

- zod v4 has been released, we're using `z4` imported like `import z4 from 'zod/v4'` to make this clear.
- remeda is in use in the frontend and backend - useful during data processing/transformation.
- Next.js 15 (React 19). RSCs and Next.js server features aren't used, in favour of Convex.
- Tailwind v4 - the javascript config file is no longer used, everything is defined in [globals.css](mdc:app/globals.css).
- All shadcn/ui components are installed.

### Convex

- Convex uses their own V8 runtime, similar to Cloudflare Workers, but with better support for language features.
- Map.groupBy is supported, and it is an incredible way to group then iterate through items, but we can't use it in the browser.
- Convex will throw during compile if it finds any dir/file with a dash in it (e.g. `my-file.ts`), so use camelCase.
- Convex queries/mutations/actions can't be used in files with dots in the name (e.g. `my.file.ts`), so use camelCase.
