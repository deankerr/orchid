# Project Notes

## Environment

- bun is the package manager, and script runner. The bun runtime is never actually used.
- `bun check` to typecheck and lint your work.
- Don't try to start the dev server. It's already running in my terminal.

## Libraries

- zod v4 has been released, we're using `z4` imported like `import z4 from 'zod/v4'` to make this clear.
- remeda is in use in the frontend and backend - useful during data processing/transformation.
- Next.js 15 (React 19). RSCs and Next.js server features aren't used, in favour of Convex.
- Tailwind v4 - the javascript config file is no longer used, everything is defined in [globals.css](mdc:app/globals.css).
- All shadcn/ui components are installed.

## Status

- Production version has been soft-launched and is publicly available at a temporary URL.
- The snapshot system is running, creating production and archived data.
- There are no public links to the site, nor has it been promoted - traffic is negligible.
- It's acceptable to launch features in an alpha/beta state, as we gain feedback from product testers.
