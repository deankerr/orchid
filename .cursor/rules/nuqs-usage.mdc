# NuQS Usage

## SPA Architecture with URL State

- Using nuqs to create a single-page app with URL-based state management
- Next.js page files removed - everything is components with conditional rendering
- Main app logic in [app/page.tsx](mdc:app/page.tsx) with [components/app-layout.tsx](mdc:components/app-layout.tsx)

## Navigation Pattern

- **Use Links with params** for navigation: `<Link href="/?model=slug">`
- **Don't use `useQueryState` setters** in components for navigation
- Read query state in hooks like [hooks/use-filtered-models.ts](mdc:hooks/use-filtered-models.ts)

## Key URLs

- `/?search=query` - filtered model list
- `/?model=slug` - specific model view
- Can combine: `/?model=slug&search=query`

## Benefits

- Rapid experimentation without Next.js routing complexity
- Shareable URLs with all state preserved
- Better fit for Convex client-side rendering
