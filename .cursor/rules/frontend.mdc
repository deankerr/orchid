# Frontend Guide

- Our audience is highly technical and knowledgable about working with OpenRouter and LLMs in general.
- They know what variables, parameters, context lengths, quantization etc. are.
- They're interested in the all of the details of pricing - cache reads, reasoning tokens, etc.
- We don't need to try to make this information seem "friendly", in fact the opposite is kinda cool.
- We can make it easily accessible, comparable, grokable.
- It is appropriate to show raw variable names/object keys at times - these values could be copied and pasted by users into their own code, e.g. `response_format`, `structured_outputs`.
- This most importantly includes model slugs, which are used directly by programmers.
- Mobile use isn't a focus right now, while we establish more data-heavy patterns.

## Style

- We're going for a stark, technical, functional look at this stage. Monospace fonts, monochromatic colors, pointy corners, less padding.
- Think "modern terminal aesthetic", (but not literal shell character etc.). shadcn/ui will naturally lend to this with little customization.
- Text is a good place to feature some color, e.g. status, variant labels.
- Icons can be used where appropriate.
- Avoid shadows.

## Libraries/Components

- All shadcn/ui components are installed.
- We use Tailwind v4 - much is the same, but there is no longer a javascript config file. It is all defined in [globals.css](mdc:app/globals.css).
- Use the standard shadcn/ui theme variables. Do not add custom colors, background colors, border radius, etc.
- We can and should add more colors to our theme as needed - e.g. "success", "warning", etc. (but more specific to our needs). Always refer to [globals.css](mdc:app/globals.css) when considering breaking from the basic theme.
- Do not add components to the components/ui folder - leave this for shadcn/ui.
- Add components to the root components folder for now.
- `border-border` is already the default border color, you don't need to specify it.
- `text-xs` is the default for Badge.
