# Tips

## Zod

- Zod v4 has been released! The API is mainly the same but it's much faster, and more convenient native error formatting.
- `z4.strictObject` and `z4.looseObject` should be used instead of `.strict()` and `.passthrough()`
- We're using `z4` imported like `import z4 from 'zod/v4'` to make this clearer.
- The `zod` package actually still contains Zod v3 imported from its regular location.

## OpenRouter Zod Schemas

- When validating API artifacts, we utilise zod's characteristic of pruning properties from the result data if they are not specified in the schema, removing unnecessary values and duplicated/embedded entities from the source data.
- The snapshots system uses the 'passthrough' method to partially validate artifact properties where necessary, while leaving the resulting data intact in an unvalidated state.
- 'Strict' schemas intend to validate the full structure of each major entity, existing to confirm that our understanding of the structure of each artifact is correct and up to date.
  - This may include data we don't need, or have determined is vestigial in practice (eg. despite what its key implies, it is always null).
  - Many entities include recursively embedded sub-entities - we don't need to validate these as they are of little practical value and always checked elsewhere.
  - These schemas could be used as part of a health monitoring component in the future, detecting changes in the data structures over time.
- Do not export subcomponent schemas, ie. nested objects, unless there is a specific reason to do so (there usually is not).
- Do not document "expected" or "assumed" information derived only from the key name - these names are often deceptive or outdated.
- `null` and `optional` are NOT equivilant. The API uses both somewhat inconsistantly - track them accurately. There are NO observed instances of a truly `nullish` property.

## Frontend

- Dev UI only for now, rendering all technical details while we're still refining our data structures.
- Desktop UI only for now, don't be concerned about our dev views rendering on mobile. Use the space to show more data on screen.
- We're using ConvexQueryCacheProvider, so it's fine to query large amounts of data and consume it directly without need for Context/state management etc. beyond what the current view requires.
- React 19, Next.js 15, Tailwind 4
- Put the components we're currently developing in the top level components folder. Only the shadcn/ui components should be in components/ui.
- Use a clean, techinical looking style. `font-mono`, no background colors/shades. Use colored text to call out atypical values.
